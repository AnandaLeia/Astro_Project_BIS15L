## Data Cleaning
Figure out meanings for all the variables and their inputs
Convert longitude and latitude columns to numeric
Convert calendar_date column to date and separate date month year into three columns
Map all eclipses by longitute and latitude
Create app displaying maps of eclipses by date
If we want to put solar and lunar onto same app, MAYBE figure out a way to combine the datasets into on, create a new variable for type of eclipse (solar or lunar)
Create a way for people to select by type of eclipse (annular, total, partial, hybrid)
Make it look nice
