Ananda Leia, Katie Ricketts, Jon Sunkari
BIS 15L Winter 2023

Collaborative mapping project of lunar and solar eclipse occurrences over 3 millenia period.

**This repository includes:**
 - folders for each individual member and their work (titled with member names)
 - a folder of brainstorming possible datasets for this project (Potential Datasets)
 - a folder of the data we used for the final project (NASA Lunar and Solar Eclipses)
 - a collaborative RMarkdown withour final app and plots (final_eclipse_app.Rmd)
 - a stand-alone .R script with just the final app (final_eclipse_app.R)

**Member Contributions:** 

Ananda:
 - 

Katie:
 - converted latitude and longitude coordinates into a usable format
 - built a mapping framework and tested filtering for mapping
 - built filters for eclipse types
 - created new columns for broad eclipse types
 - built plots of eclipse type proportions
 - researched eclipse mechanics

Jon:
 - built a shiny dashboard app that tracks peak eclipse-viewing locations by year, and displays them on a map (ggmap):
   - created user input option for type of eclipse and year
   - created user input option for sub-type of eclipse (which changes based on their choice for type of eclipse)
   - customized layout with CSS
